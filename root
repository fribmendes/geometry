For example, testing if the functions were present in the shell before sourcing the internally shipped version would help avoid overwriting a newer version with an older embedded version.\n\nThis isn't strictly necessary since loading async after this code would give the appropriate result, redefining things again, but ... sure would be nice to be smarter. :)","files":null}]}

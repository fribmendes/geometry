Using the current `master` version of geometry, when starting up the prompt symbol uses the error exit prompt. Example:\n\n\u003cimg width=\"650\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-02-28 at 10 09 56\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4325027/36782086-b1803c76-1c6f-11e8-8c48-001a0496426e.png\"\u003e\n\nHowever, when I echo the contents of the `$?` variable, before the prompt is rendered, it is still `0`. Since I'm running a customized geometry, is any of you able to reproduce this? @desyncr @jedahan","files":null}]}

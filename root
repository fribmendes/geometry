If you are using `oh-my-zsh`, this feature can be enabled by including the [vi-mode](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/plugins/vi-mode/vi-mode.plugin.zsh) plugin.\n\nHowever, the interest with `geometry` is to port the visual indicator over.  [vi-mode](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/plugins/vi-mode/vi-mode.plugin.zsh#L43) implements its own visual indicator function `vi_mode_prompt_info()` where it toggles between `vimcmd` and `main` mode indicating `NORMAL` and `INSERT` mode respectively.\n\nThe request here is to include the visual indicator as a plugin in `geometry`. Thank you in advance.\n\n\\cc @fribmendes, @desyncr","files":null}]}

However, it is clunky to customize, as seen in #226 .\n\nLet's look at exposing all the inner functionality - `_symbol`, `_branch`, `_status`, `_conflicts`, `_time`, and `_stashes`, which would allow us to get rid of the clunky  `GEOMETRY_GIT_SHOW_{CONFLICTS,TIME,STASHES}` vars, and reorder as the user sees fit.\n\nWe can also investigate the performance penalty of using zsh's builtin `vcs_info` for some of the prompt.","files":null}]}

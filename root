I previously had agnoster as my theme and the virtualenv prompt was working fine, but tonight I wanted to try something different and I really like this theme.. so I installed it and set everything up.. the problem is that I cant get to show the virtualenv Im currently on, and since I work in python that's really importat for me.. I have tried many different ways to achieve this but none seem to work.. adding this line \n`GEOMETRY_PROMPT_PLUGINS=(virtualenv docker_machine exec_time git hg)`\nto the zsh file doesnt seem to do anything, and if i remove for example the git there, it shows and error \n`bad set of key/value pairs for associative array`\n\ndoes anyone knows what can be going on?","files":null}]}

Back then it was a good idea as it loaded plugins configuration-free.\n\nCurrent implementation (right and left prompt pluggable) enables further customization and it makes sense to be able to tell the plugins to either load at the right or left prompt:\n\n    GEOMETRY_PROMPT_PLUGINS_SECONDARY=(custom_plugin ...)\n    # Or\n    GEOMETRY_PROMPT_PLUGINS_PRIMARY=(custom_plugin ...)\n\nThis conflicts with the current plugin loading approach as by default self-registration uses the `SECONDARY` prompt as target.\n\nWe do support both registration methods but should update the documentation to use the configuration approach rather than self-registration.\n\nAn example configuration would be such as:\n\n    # Add the plugin to a prompt, in this example \"secondary\"\n    GEOMETRY_PROMPT_PLUGINS_SECONDARY=(custom_plugin ...)\n\n    # Source the plugin script BEFORE geometry\n    source custom_plugin.zsh\n\n    # Finally source geometry theme\n    source geometry.zsh","files":null}]}

This causes the code to grow large and maintenance becomes a problem. This will become an issue as more prompts are added.\n\nTo be able to manage this issue I propose to turn most informative prompts (git, virtualenv, python, etc) into a separate file that can be loaded at runtime. This will keep separate the base prompt from the informative prompts, making maintenance a bit easier. Also performance-wise seems reasonable to keep unloaded unused prompts.\n\nThis structure will also provide the ability to create custom -user made- prompts, outside the geometry code base.\n\nImplementation will require to establish a common interface for the prompts (function and variable names) as well as a globally available array to register a given plugins/prompt. Similar to https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/docs/highlighters.md\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit: Probably Fixes #24","files":null}]}

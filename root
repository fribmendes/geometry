So if a new user or contributor comes up, we won't notice it.\n\nAfter speaking with @desyncr about it, there are two good options. Slack or IRC.\n\nSlack requires registering and is a lot more bloated. We don't need any integrations and we just need a single room. It's also very eager on resources.\n\nGood old IRC doesn't need no registration, we can just add a link to web IRC for users that are unfamiliar with it and we can easily idle there. It also has more adoption than gitter.\n\nI'd like to hear more takes on this before making any decision.\n\n/cc @desyncr @jedahan","files":null}]}

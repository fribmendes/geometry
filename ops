So basically the problem is that when there are too many icons on the right side of the terminal (git info) then the IDE's terminal will render new line. \n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7236601/36412461-b3c6d108-161a-11e8-8988-07f237ed0afb.png)\n\nThere is also another glitch where if I start typing too fast before the git data renders then the first character is kind of \"out of index\" \n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7236601/36412675-80de1034-161b-11e8-9efd-d0ba4b0d3ca2.png)\n\nJust let me know if this is a known issue or there is any fix via config. If not then I will contact IntelliJ's support. Thanks.","files":null}]}

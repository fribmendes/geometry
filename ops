As of now I think we can go for it.\n\n  - [ ] Create `CHANGELOG.md` with `v0.1.0` entry, just \"Initial release\" would suffice \n  - [ ] Update README.md with a release badge (see https://img.shields.io/github/release/qubyte/rubidium.svg)\n  - [ ] Create release draft in https://github.com/frmendes/geometry/releases, thank our active contributors (castellanprime, ChauTNguyen) and link to https://github.com/frmendes/geometry/graphs/contributors\n\nA future possibility is to have release schedules. But given our codebase and activity it seems unnecessary.\n\nWe may automate this but for now this is all we need to release `v0.1.0`.\n\nThoughts? @frmendes @jedahan","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"d031c473ea44f2997770f844cf5bd248db34a431"},"timestamp":1489617909,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NjkwMzMwOA==","github-url":"https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/issues/121#issuecomment-286903308"},"message":"I'd like to take this on.

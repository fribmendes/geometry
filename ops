I only open sourced it later, so even though I refactored out most of the code, there are still some bits that are there purely because of aesthetic preference.\n\nIf you can refactor that into a config variable like the rest of the theme it would be great! And if you find other options that you think you would prefer to customize, feel free to extract it out to a variable and submit a PR! I'd really appreciate it.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e531cb03e1c4db4dc2e0f0da387e766e272435ed"},"timestamp":1472640358,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzcyNzUwNQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/issues/11#issuecomment-243727505"},"message":"You got it!","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"d031c473ea44f2997770f844cf5bd248db34a431"},"timestamp":1473071456,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDcxNDgwNg==","github-url":"https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/issues/11#issuecomment-244714806"},"message":"Are you up for submiting a PR with this option?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e531cb03e1c4db4dc2e0f0da387e766e272435ed"},"timestamp":1473126519,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDgzMTU1Ng==","github-url":"https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/issues/11#issuecomment-244831556"},"message":"@frmendes yes, apologies, as soon as i catch a break, sometime this week.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"d031c473ea44f2997770f844cf5bd248db34a431"},"timestamp":1473146342,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDg2OTE4NA==","github-url":"https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/issues/11#issuecomment-244869184"},"message":"@acidjazz, no worries, happens to everyone!

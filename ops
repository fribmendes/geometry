I see more advantages in allowing most plugins as it increases user interaction and contribution, it's easier for users and a great byproduct (which has actually motivated me to step down a bit from responding to issues) is that there have been quite a few new contributors to open source through geometry.\n\nAfter giving this a thought, I got a bit scared that having strict criteria and pushing plugins to a \"User Plugins\" section might put some barriers to that. People might think twice before contributing while I'd rather have a PR and give out feedback. If it turns out the plugin is really not that necessary, it's all good. Just correct the PR to add it to a README.\n\nHowever, I also agree that [this plugin](https://github.com/desyncr/geometry-pretty-git) is simply a great demonstration of sense of humor, not to be merged, and I would very much be ok with having it in a \"User Plugins\" section. I think I'd rather go with that and be a lot more lenient with user contributions. Accept most plugins and praise \"outstanding\" custom user plugins -- say if someone decides to turn geometry into all emojis -- by adding them to a public list.\n\nFinally, I share @desyncr 's concern for unused plugin maintenance. I don't have a clear idea on what is the best option for that but I'm a bit more concerned about raising barriers to contributions than unused plugin maintenance. I'm all up for suggestions on this and would very much appreciate constructive feedback.\n\nWhat do you both think?\n\nPS:\n\n\u003e I would not like to see geometry start to grow it's own package manager which is the road I see this going down.\n\nI don't want to detach geometry from existing tooling and I don't want it to become its own package manager. The way I see it is that it's transforming into a tool for prompt building with sane defaults and easy customization -- the plugins. I actually think that this transformation is positive. With just a couple of lines I can completely change the look of my terminal without bringing in extra dependencies.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"d4eb9eb05c8e7e760e59ab8c578fae019321a3fc"},"timestamp":1485966277,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjcwNDA3Mw==","github-url":"https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/issues/100#issuecomment-276704073"},"message":"Do you mean that you configure `GEOMETRY_PROMPT_PREFIX` like so:\n\n    GEOMETRY_PROMPT_PREFIX=$'\\n'\n\nand it doesn't show up?","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"d4eb9eb05c8e7e760e59ab8c578fae019321a3fc"},"timestamp":1485966283,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDk0NTAyMTYyNA=="},"added":["bug"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e7fe5ca3064811fa83d1716f18c44f503f56ce0e"},"timestamp":1485974688,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3Njc0MzYwOA==","github-url":"https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/issues/100#issuecomment-276743608"},"message":"I mean that I configured it like that and it shows up like in the screenshot.

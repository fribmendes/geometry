It makes sense to go the Unix-way: focus on zsh and do it well. If we consider porting to fish, then we should do fish well. Not a hybrid between both.\n\nThe unknown issues worry me especially because we have no tests. So, here's my suggestion: stabilize geometry (finish with the themes, update some outdated READMEs, etc), make a release, update the README to point to the release tag when installing. Start porting to `zstyle` and iterate over bugs that arise.\n\nHow do you feel about this?","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"d031c473ea44f2997770f844cf5bd248db34a431"},"timestamp":1530719101,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE3MTY2MDY5Mzg="},"added":["enhancement"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"940aabe64f74a4490b5129922ab6d0d7b9926a38"},"timestamp":1540833153,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzk5NjM0MQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/issues/219#issuecomment-433996341"},"message":"I've changed my mind on this since the benefits are so minor and the downsides are not.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"940aabe64f74a4490b5129922ab6d0d7b9926a38"},"timestamp":1540833153,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTkzMjg4NjA4Nw=="},"status":2}]}

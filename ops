So `mnml` is the default branch when you git clone geometry-zsh/geometry. I'd imagine zplug should respect default branches if they are not `master`. Alternatively we can rename `mnml` to `master` but I'd rather change it to `main` or `stable` tbh, which would still have the same issue.","files":null}]}

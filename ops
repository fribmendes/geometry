Really like the flexibility it gives for users to customize. Not a fan of `pwd` configuration. Lets face it, the only thing `prompt` would be showing is the directory. Well, symbol as well, but that's configurable.\n\nIf we're allowing pwd configuration might as well allow users to completely switch out the left prompt.","files":null}]}

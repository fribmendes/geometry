However, it is clunky to customize, as seen in #226 .\n\nLet's look at exposing all the inner functionality - `_symbol`, `_branch`, `_status`, `_conflicts`, `_time`, and `_stashes`, which would allow us to get rid of the clunky  `GEOMETRY_GIT_SHOW_{CONFLICTS,TIME,STASHES}` vars, and reorder as the user sees fit.\n\nWe can also investigate the performance penalty of using zsh's builtin `vcs_info` for some of the prompt.\n\nOf course, we can also just rebase #226 on top of mnml and see how that feels as well!","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"940aabe64f74a4490b5129922ab6d0d7b9926a38"},"timestamp":1546447668,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDkxNjU1Ng==","github-url":"https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/issues/242#issuecomment-450916556"},"message":"fixed in https://github.com/jedahan/geometry/commit/5ec97e39400a3a0cd9f0bbed4796167b65a9eddd , will track performance vs vcs_info in another issue","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"940aabe64f74a4490b5129922ab6d0d7b9926a38"},"timestamp":1546447669,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjA1MDc1NjQyMg=="},"status":2}]}

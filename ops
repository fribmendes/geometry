I made the custom plugin [geometry-terraform](https://github.com/pbar1/geometry-terraform) to display the Terraform workspace of the current directory, and while it does work, the plugin placement is off:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26949935/43237850-42642d9c-9051-11e8-999a-b427b1f46424.png)\n\nThis is the configuration I'm using in my zshrc, and I'd assume terraform would come first:\n```\n▲ ~ cat .zshrc | rg GEOMETRY\nexport GEOMETRY_PROMPT_PLUGINS=(terraform exec_time jobs node virtualenv kube git)\n```\n\nVersus this, the output I get from `geometry_plugin_list`; terraform is now at the end of the list, while the order of the rest of the plugins is still intact:\n```\n▲ ~ geometry_plugin_list\nprimary:\npath hostname\nsecondary:\nexec_time jobs node virtualenv kube git terraform\n```\n\nWhat can I do to ensure the ordering is correct?\n\n(This theme is incredible btw!

It would be a nice addition I think üëç  So we'll keep that in mind.\n\nThere is some documentation about how we manage [plugins](https://github.com/frmendes/geometry/blob/master/plugins/README.md) and prompts that may help you with this.\n\nFor a start do [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and clone your fork locally:\n\n    git clone git@github.com:vincecampanale/geometry.git\n\nDo create a bugfix branch to work on (a common practice):\n\n    git branch -b bugfix-git-prompt-spaces\n\nWhen developing what I do is configure geometry theme simply by sourcing it this way:\n\n   `~/.zshrc`:\n\n    source /path/to/geometry.zsh\n\nThen hack, open a new terminal/tab/panel, check and repeat.\n\nFinally, when you see your changes working, do push your changes to github and make a PR:\n\n    git push -u origin bugfix-git-prompt-spaces\n\nYou should see a \"Make Pull Request\" button (or similar wording) on the Github web interface.\n\nWe'll review the changes, test them on various configurations (pretty much like you would) and provide as much feedback as you'd need.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"abd143fb16a184e353306d7c6d397f7a6a1dda14"},"timestamp":1481847501,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzQ4MzU4MA==","github-url":"https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/issues/61#issuecomment-267483580"},"message":"Okay, forked and cloned. Currently familiarizing myself with the code. What exactly is zsh? From my Googling I've found that it's kind of a Terminal application that does more than just standard Terminal. How do I enable zsh in my terminal and set it to 'geometry' mode. I added a line `source ~/directories/to/geometry.zsh` to `~/.zshrc` but Terminal hasn't changed. I'd like to get used to using the application in order to contribute more.

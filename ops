I see more advantages in allowing most plugins as it increases user interaction and contribution, it's easier for users and a great byproduct (which has actually motivated me to step down a bit from responding to issues) is that there have been quite a few new contributors to open source through geometry.\n\nAfter giving this a thought, I got a bit scared that having strict criteria and pushing plugins to a \"User Plugins\" section might put some barriers to that. People might think twice before contributing while I'd rather have a PR and give out feedback. If it turns out the plugin is really not that necessary, it's all good. Just correct the PR to add it to a README.\n\nHowever, I also agree that [this plugin](https://github.com/desyncr/geometry-pretty-git) is simply a great demonstration of sense of humor, not to be merged, and I would very much be ok with having it in a \"User Plugins\" section. I think I'd rather go with that and be a lot more lenient with user contributions. Accept most plugins and praise \"outstanding\" custom user plugins -- say if someone decides to turn geometry into all emojis -- by adding them to a public list.\n\nFinally, I share @desyncr 's concern for unused plugin maintenance. I don't have a clear idea on what is the best option for that but I'm a bit more concerned about raising barriers to contributions than unused plugin maintenance. I'm all up for suggestions on this and would very much appreciate constructive feedback.\n\nWhat do you both think?\n\nPS:\n\n\u003e I would not like to see geometry start to grow it's own package manager which is the road I see this going down.\n\nI don't want to detach geometry from existing tooling and I don't want it to become its own package manager. The way I see it is that it's transforming into a tool for prompt building with sane defaults and easy customization -- the plugins. I actually think that this transformation is positive. With just a couple of lines I can completely change the look of my terminal without bringing in extra dependencies.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"940aabe64f74a4490b5129922ab6d0d7b9926a38"},"timestamp":1485558040,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTc5ODE4NA==","github-url":"https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/issues/97#issuecomment-275798184"},"message":"@desyncr when you say add section, where do you mean to add it?\n\nIf it is in the readme or a wiki page (or both), I think that is a great idea for people to quickly share cool stuff they have made (like any of the awesome- lists).\n\nI think it would also be nice to add to the readme a quick 'howto use third-party geometry plugins' (clone it/zplug it somewhere, and source after geometry.zsh).\n\nI do want to encourage users to submit their cool plugins to the main project - right now that number is small and we can take it on a case-by-case basis.

It has to do with setting the permissions set on folders and file. If you give it a `chmod 777 \u003cfolder\u003e` you get the ugly colors. but if you set it to `chmod 755 \u003cfolder\u003e` you'll have the correct coloration.\n\nFrom my research it seems that the way Mac sets `LS` colors is not so well which cause the weird colors. I am going to check the above that you posted though and see if it achieves anything but as far as a fix its the above.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"940aabe64f74a4490b5129922ab6d0d7b9926a38"},"timestamp":1566384147,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjU3MjYxODk3OA=="},"status":2}]}

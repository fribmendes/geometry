I randombly fell on [#102](https://github.com/frmendes/geometry/pull/102)  and specifically on [this line](https://github.com/frmendes/geometry/pull/102/commits/07a810eff33950a49de1c8809daeaa33c56bb553#diff-37d2e8a43274d6fbaf5b762a55f5138cR36). I have very limited zsh knowledge but I guess that this defines `GEOMETRY_PROMPT_PREFIX` to be `$\\n` if it is not set. \n\nBy adding it in a configuration file with an empty setting, I guess it is treated as \"not set\" so it defaults to a new line. \n\nIs it possible to override this somehow and get a single line prompt?","files":null}]}

With some characters, especially unicode, there was a tendency to over-estimate the character width.\n\nIf you Google around for `zsh tab completion duplicate character` you'll find a lot of recomendations saying to wrap the troublesome part in `%{...%}` to escape some color code sequences. This tells zsh the color codes have zero-width: they should be interpreted but don't occupy on-screen space, which intuitively makes sense.\n\nHowever, if you try this in geometry, in the line I previously linked, you'll see that it starts ignoring the space after the prompt character, unless you are on a git repo. This ticked me off because it meant the width of the character assumed by zsh was definitely wrong.\n\nInstead, I had to explicitly tell zhs the width of the prompt character, by wrapping it in `%1{...%}`.\n\nI wouldn't have noticed it only happened with specific prompt characters without your comment, thanks for that one!\n\nAs for your comment, feel free to open a PR!\n\nI'm not sure I want to bind geometry, to any particular language, which means I'd eventually put something for rbenv/rvm and nvm as well. I'm on the fence on how fast the version check is as well. geometry is starting to get a bit slow, especially in large repos.

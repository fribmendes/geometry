It would be nice to have clear guidelines on when to use which, or to settle on just one.\n\n`echo` is used everywhere, but supposedly has surprising behavior / is not portable. It is still my preference due to familiarity and as far as I know has not lead to any problems.\n\n`print` is only used in **geometry.zsh**. It has a lot of features, and a better defined api, but will often require flags and be harder to read and maybe less familiar. What would break if we used `echo` instead in **geometry.zsh**?\n\n`printf` is only used in **functions/geometry_status.zsh** replaced with `print -f` if wanted.","files":null}]}

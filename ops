The host_info plugin was made for Geometry V1 (`master` branch) and is not compatible with V2. Converting it should not be too difficult, but it will not work as-is.\n\nAlso, I'm not too familiar with antigen, but geometry being an oh-my-zsh theme, I'm not sure if you can just source it directly like that, it would probably need to be configured as your OMZ theme by setting `ZSH_THEME=geometry` before OMZ gets sourced by antigen. I may be wrong on this.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"a0b3ff67cfb1bd9c83619f49714633839dc00004"},"timestamp":1572296109,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzE0MTgxNg==","github-url":"https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/issues/281#issuecomment-547141816"},"message":"You are correct that I am on `mnml`, it works correctly on the `master`-branch. Thanks! Do you know where I can find out more about how plugins work in v2? I can't seem to find any plugins for v2 to look at, and the wiki only mentions [this, apparently outdated guide](https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/blob/master/plugins/README.md). I'd rather not stay on v1.\n\nSourcing it directly apparently works fine without me setting `ZSH_THEME`.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"a0b3ff67cfb1bd9c83619f49714633839dc00004"},"timestamp":1572296235,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzE0MjU4Ng==","github-url":"https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/issues/281#issuecomment-547142586"},"message":"Wait, I can look at the built-in plugins.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"a0b3ff67cfb1bd9c83619f49714633839dc00004"},"timestamp":1572296235,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjc1MDA0NDM2Nw=="},"status":2},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"a0b3ff67cfb1bd9c83619f49714633839dc00004"},"timestamp":1572296264,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzE0Mjc1NQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/issues/281#issuecomment-547142755"},"message":"Thanks for the help!","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"940aabe64f74a4490b5129922ab6d0d7b9926a38"},"timestamp":1572387362,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzY1MzU0Ng==","github-url":"https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/issues/281#issuecomment-547653546"},"message":"If there are any functions you find useful please share them!","files":null}]}

I think the tab gets swallowed in my browser. Maybe using a gitter wrapped 'native' client would help with the idling/realtime issue...","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"d031c473ea44f2997770f844cf5bd248db34a431"},"timestamp":1502301307,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTMzMjU5Ng==","github-url":"https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/issues/176#issuecomment-321332596"},"message":"I also use Slack more, but the fact that it's so bloated and a pain to add users, makes me a bit sceptical regarding using it for this.\n\nI use a gitter client but it's no use, tbh. It doesn't have as much active users and it's much of a pain to iddle in. I need to have the gitter client running at all times, instead of using a bouncer on a server and being occasionally notified like on IRC. That's my favorite option.\n\nI've also been finding gitter a bit less intuitive and \"closed\" - maybe not the best word to describe it, but the process of joining in is just a bit harder than IRC.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"d031c473ea44f2997770f844cf5bd248db34a431"},"timestamp":1502374680,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTU2NDc5Ng==","github-url":"https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/issues/176#issuecomment-321564796"},"message":"@desyncr what's your take on this?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"d4eb9eb05c8e7e760e59ab8c578fae019321a3fc"},"timestamp":1502374934,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTU2NjAxMg==","github-url":"https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry/issues/176#issuecomment-321566012"},"message":"I'm up for IRC.
